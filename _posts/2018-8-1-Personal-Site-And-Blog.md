GitHub provides a service for hosting project- or personal-level websites, with Jekyll integration. Jekyll enables quick and easy generation of static websites using publicly available, shared, or bought themes for your webpage. This GitHub Pages+Jekyll integration means a lot of the work of webpage design behind-the-scenes development is removed, so you can focus on populating your new site with interesting content. If you are a web developer, this is maybe limiting and not all that great. But if, like me, you merely dabble in web development but wouldn't include it in your CV, this convenience factor is a major plus.
 
 To make my first personal website and blog, I followed the detailed and helpful directions [here](https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/) and [here](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/). In summary, I forked the jekyll-now repo, renamed to "myusername.github.io" and filled out/modified the template files in /_posts/ directory and the file '_config.yml', following the helpful author annotations, to add personal content. Indeed, you will notice I haven't modified my fork of the jekyll-now repo very much yet.
 
 I'm just using the default theme currently (as of 8/1/18), but I enjoy its minimalism, and frankly it gets the job done! I explored other options for blogging with code-heavy text and formatting with WordPress, but so far I've been blown away with the simplicity of hosting everything on GitHub. And rest assured, this example only scratches the surface of what is possible for themes, formatting, and content layout using GitHub.
