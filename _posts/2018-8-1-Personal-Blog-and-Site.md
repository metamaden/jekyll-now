title: How I Made A Personal Blog and Site With GitHub and Jekyl
---

GitHub provides a service for hosting project- or personal-level websites, with Jekyl integration. Jekyl enables quick and easy generation of static websites using publicly available, shared, or bought themes for your webpage. This GitHub Pages+Jekyl integration means a lot of the work of webpage design and maintenance is removed, so you can focus on adding content to your new site.

To make my first personal website and blog, I followed the detailed and helpful directions [here](https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/) and [here](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/). In summary, I forked the jekyl-now repo, renamed to "myusername.github.io" and filled out/modified the template files in /_posts/ directory and the file '_config.yml', following the helpful author annotations, to add personal content. Indeed, you will notice I haven't modified my fork of the jekyl-now repo very much yet.

I'm just using the default theme currently (as of 8/1/18), but I enjoy its minimalism, and frankly it gets the job done! I explored other options for blogging with code-heavy text and formatting with WordPress, but so far I've been blown away with the simplicity of hosting everything on GitHub. And rest assured, this only scratches the surface of what is possible for themes, formatting, and content layout.
