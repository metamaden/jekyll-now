Sean Maden (GitHub username: metamaden) is a Ph.D student in Computational Biology at Oregion Health & Sciences University, Department of Biomedical Engineering, with Dr. Nellore's Lab. He is a researcher and scholar of eigenetics and integrative computational oncology.

### Research Background/Interests

I am a bioinformatician specializing in compute systems for the study of epigenetics, oncolongy, and integration of different molecular data types. My work is highly collaborative, and I am interested in opportunities to expand digital workflows and systems to tackle reproducibility and cutting edge biomedical science.

I have extensive programming background with R and using Bioconductor resources. My early years in bioinformatics focused on analaysis of HM450 methylation array platform data, and I have since worked extensively with gene expression, variant sequencing, and multitudinous clinical data types. I developed a few pilot R packages and shiny apps to aid in methylation data analysis. As a Ph.D scholar, I am currently pursuing pan-cancer research of epigenetics and integrative 'omics data, and will develop analysis tools for cloud and remote platforms using a variety of languages, including R, Python, C++, SQL and others.
