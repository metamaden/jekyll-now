Sean is a Computational Biology Ph.D candidate (second year) at Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) in Portland, OR. He is advised by Prof. Abhi Nellore, and his affiliations include PDXgx (Prof. Reid Thompson and affiliates) and the Johns Hopkins University Genomics Collective. Sean is a researcher and scholar of bioinformatics, biostatistics, epigenetics, biological aging, and integrative computational biology.

### Research experience and interests

Sean's Ph.D. work touches on the fields of bioinformatics, biostatistics, and computation, with a scientific focus on basic research of epigenetic dynamics and biological aging in normal and cancer tissues. His study approach uses cross-study analyses for quality control and normalization, which leverages more abundant and varied available samples while avoiding critical issues with traditional meta-analyses. His initial first-author paper as a Ph.D. student characterized 35,360 DNA methylation array samples obtained programmatically from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO).

### Programming experience and interests

Sean excels at workflows using public genomics data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), GEO, and elsewhere. He's constantly seeking new opportunities to expand digital workflows to tackle reproducibility and cutting edge biomedical science. In his first year as a Ph.D. student, Sean developed a generalizable server software system, [`recount-methylation-server`](https://github.com/metamaden/recount-methylation-server), which extensively manages and versions batch genomics data downloads.

Sean possesses over 5 years of full-time programming experience extending to numerous significant first- and co-author contributions in published and peer-reviewed scientific works (see his [CV](https://github.com/metamaden/CV_repo) for full publications list). He uses R and Python extensively, with advanced utilization of the `minfi`, `ggplot2`, `data.table`, `numpy`, and `pandas` libraries in particular. He's actively working on [`recountmethylation`](https://github.com/metamaden/recountmethylation), a new R/Bioconductor package incorporating `SummarizedExperiment`, `HDF5`, and `DelayedArray` object classes for efficient management of large genomics data files. He utilizes all manner of OS environments and systems, including remote server environments (CentOS 7) and batch management systems (slurm). 

### Hobbies

Outside of his bioinformatics pursuits, Sean is passionate about vintage scooters, data-driven blogs, tech hackathons, data activism, microbrews, board games, and bouldering.
