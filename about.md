Greetings! My name is Sean Maden, I am a Computational Biology Ph.D student at Oregion Health & Science University in Portland, OR. I work in Dr. Abhinav Nellore's Lab, in affiliation with PDXGx and Dr. Reid Thompson's Lab. I am a researcher and scholar of bioinformatics, epigenetics, and integrative computational oncology.

### Programming and Research Background

I specialize in compute systems for the study of epigenetics, oncolongy, and integration of different molecular data types. My work is highly collaborative, and I am constantly seeking new opportunities to expand digital workflows and systems to tackle reproducibility and cutting edge biomedical science. If you are interested in a collaboration, don't hesitate to reach out!

I have extensive programming background in R, especially applying Bioconductor resources. My background includes specialization in study of molecular and epigenetic dynamics in gastroesophageal cancers using methylation arrays. I have since worked extensively with gene expression, variant sequencing, and various clinical data types. I excel at analysis workflows that include public data repositories, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). I developed a few pilot R packages and shiny apps to aid in methylation data analysis. 

As a Ph.D candidate and researcher at the Knight Cancer Institute, I am designing a platform-specific auto-compilation technology to analyze all publically available samples from GEO, which I am coding with Python, Bash, and R. This technology utilizes extensive server functionality, including automated job queue management with streaming to a backend SQLite database, file versioning and management with a Mongo document database, and preprocessing functionality that uses MetaSRA-pipeline. I work in all manner of OS environments.

Outside of my bioinformatics pursuits, I am passionate about data-driven lay press writing, hackathons, data activism, microbrews, board games, and bouldering.
