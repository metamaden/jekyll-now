### About me

Sean is a Computational Biology Ph.D candidate (second year) at Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) in Portland, OR. I'm advised by Prof. Abhi Nellore, and my affiliations include PDXgx (Prof. Reid Thompson and affiliates) and the Johns Hopkins University Genomics Collective. I'm a researcher and scholar of bioinformatics, epigenetics, biological aging, and integrative computational biology.

### Research and computational background

My Ph.D. work touches on the fields of bioinformatics, biostatistics, and computation, with a research focus on epigenetic dynamics and biological aging in normal and cancer tissues. My approach uses a cross-study quality control and normalization approach. This leverages more abundant and varied available samples while avoiding critical issues with traditional meta-analysis. 

I excel at workflows incorporating public genomics data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), and elsewhere, and I'm constantly seeking new opportunities to expand digital workflows to tackle reproducibility and cutting edge biomedical science. For instance, I developed a generalizable server software system, [`recountmethylation-server`](https://github.com/metamaden/recount-methylation-server), to manage and version batch downloads of arrays from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). 

I possess over 5 years of full-time programming experience, including several first- and co-author contributions to peer-reviewed studies. I use R and Python extensively, with advanced utilization of the `minfi`, `ggplot2`, `data.table`, `numpy`, and `pandas` libraries in particular. I'm actively working on [`recountmethylation`](https://github.com/metamaden/recountmethylation), a new R/Bioconductor package incorporating `SummarizedExperiment`, `HDF5`, and `DelayedArray` objects for management of large DNA methylation data files. I utilize all manner of OS environments and systems, including remote server environments (CentOS 7) and batch management systems (slurm). 

Outside of my bioinformatics pursuits, I am passionate about vintage scooters, data-driven blogs, tech hackathons, data activism, microbrews, board games, and bouldering.
