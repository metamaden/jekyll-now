Sean is a Computational Biology Ph.D candidate (second year) at Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) in Portland, OR. He is advised by Prof. Abhi Nellore, and his affiliations include PDXgx (Prof. Reid Thompson and affiliates) and the Johns Hopkins University Genomics Collective. Sean is a researcher and scholar of bioinformatics, biostatistics, epigenetics, biological aging, and integrative computational biology.

### Research and computational background

Sean's Ph.D. work touches on the fields of bioinformatics, biostatistics, and computation, with a research focus on epigenetic dynamics and biological aging in normal and cancer tissues. His approach uses cross-study analyses for quality control and normalization, which leverages more abundant and varied available samples while avoiding critical issues with traditional meta-analyses. 

Sean excels at workflows using public genomics data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), and elsewhere. He's constantly seeking new opportunities to expand digital workflows to tackle reproducibility and cutting edge biomedical science. In his first year as a Ph.D. student, Sean developed a generalizable server software system, [`recountmethylation-server`](https://github.com/metamaden/recount-methylation-server), which extensively manages and versions batch genomics data downloads. 

Sean possesses over 5 years of full-time programming experience, including several first- and co-author contributions to peer-reviewed studies. He uses R and Python extensively, with advanced utilization of the `minfi`, `ggplot2`, `data.table`, `numpy`, and `pandas` libraries in particular. He's actively working on [`recountmethylation`](https://github.com/metamaden/recountmethylation), a new R/Bioconductor package incorporating `SummarizedExperiment`, `HDF5`, and `DelayedArray` object classes for efficient management of large genomics data files. He utilizes all manner of OS environments and systems, including remote server environments (CentOS 7) and batch management systems (slurm). 

Outside of my bioinformatics pursuits, Sean is passionate about vintage scooters, data-driven blogs, tech hackathons, data activism, microbrews, board games, and bouldering.
